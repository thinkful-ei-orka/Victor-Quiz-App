'Stardew Valley Quiz App' 

Programmed by Thomas Davis and Victor Jarvis for Thinkful's Software Engineering Immersion Program, using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery.

This quiz app is based on the video game Stardew Valley, an open-ended RPG and farming simulator, available on PC (Linux, MacOS, and Windows), console (PS4, Xbox One, and Switch), and mobile (Android and iOS).

Future ideas include adding various images to title, question, and results pages and changing the in-quiz scoring element to feature items from the game.

This quiz is (currently) in development, though contributions and suggestions are welcomed.
